# recidivism_predictor_mlp
In the criminal justice system, decision-makers often rely on AI risk-assessment tools, like COMPAS, to predict an individual’s likelihood of reoffending. However, a landmark ProPublica analysis (https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm) revealed that these algorithms produce disproportionately high false-positive rates for Black defendants who are labeled “high risk” more often despite not reoffending, and disproportionately high false-negative rates for White defendants who reoffend more frequently than predicted. This model aims to decrease this diagnosis bias. Data is sourced from this repository (https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis) and a multi-layer perceptron model is utilised. This model fulfils part of a final project in a Machine Learning II course at UChicago, as a part of its MS in Applied Data Science program. See **final_mlp.ipyb** for the final model and code. See https://github.com/devyanimahajan/compas-analysis for more detail on other models and COMPAS.
